# meeting-value

This calculates the cost of a meeting by multiplying the average day rate of the attendees by the number of them present.

The timer can be paused and reset, and if you need to hide the day rate, check the button after entering the information. Checking the box can be done before or after the timer starts, but once it is checked the only way to get the day rate input back is to restart the timer (which you'd need to do anyway to start a new calculation).
